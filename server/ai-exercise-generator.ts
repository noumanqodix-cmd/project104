export async function generateExercisesForEquipment(
  equipment: string
): Promise<InsertExercise[]> {
  const prompt = `You are an expert strength and conditioning coach. Generate 10-15 diverse exercises specifically for ${equipment}.

**Requirements:**
1. Include exercises from ALL categories (exerciseCategory):
   - warmup: Mobility, activation, dynamic stretching
   - power: Explosive, plyometric, Olympic lift variations
   - compound: Multi-joint strength exercises
   - isolation: Single-joint exercises targeting specific muscles
   - core: Core stability, anti-rotation, planks
   - cardio: Conditioning, endurance work

2. Cover multiple movement patterns:
   - horizontal_push (chest pressing - bench press, push-ups)
   - vertical_push (shoulder pressing - overhead press)
   - horizontal_pull (back rowing - rows, face pulls)
   - vertical_pull (back pulling - pull-ups, lat pulldowns)
   - Hinge (hip dominant movements)
   - Squat (knee dominant movements)
   - Carry (loaded carries)
   - Rotation (anti-rotation, rotational power)
   - Core (planks, anti-extension, stability)
   - Hang (dead hangs, hanging variations)
   - Lunge (split stance movements)
   - Cardio (conditioning, endurance)
   - Plyometric (jumping, explosive movements)
   - Crawl (ground-based locomotion)

3. Include all difficulty levels:
   - Beginner (foundational movements)
   - Intermediate (moderate complexity)
   - Advanced (high skill/strength requirements)

4. Category guidelines:
   - warmup: Always beginner difficulty, duration-based
   - power: Include beginner-advanced, low reps with long rest
   - compound: Multi-joint, any difficulty
   - isolation: Single-joint, intermediate-advanced only (NEVER beginner)
   - core: Core patterns, any difficulty
   - cardio: Conditioning exercises, any difficulty
5. Include corrective exercises where appropriate (exercises that address common movement dysfunctions)
6. Provide specific, actionable form tips for each exercise

**Response Format (JSON):**

  "exercises": [
    {
      "name": "Exercise Name",
      "description": "Clear description of the exercise and its benefits",
      "movementPattern": "horizontal_push|vertical_push|horizontal_pull|vertical_pull|hinge|squat|carry|rotation|core|hang|lunge|cardio|plyometric|crawl",
      "equipment": ["${equipment}"],
      "difficulty": "beginner|intermediate|advanced",
      "primaryMuscles": ["broad muscle group(s)"],
      "secondaryMuscles": ["specific anatomical muscles"],
      "exerciseCategory": "warmup|power|compound|isolation|core|cardio",
      "isCorrective": 0,

        "Specific cue 2",
        "Specific cue 3"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

**Muscle Group Guidelines:**
- primaryMuscles: Use ONLY broad groups: "chest", "shoulders", "back", "core", "legs", "arms", "grip", "cardio", "full body"
- secondaryMuscles: Use specific anatomical names like "pectorals", "anterior deltoid", "latissimus dorsi", "rectus abdominis", "quadriceps", etc.

**Tracking Type Guidelines:**
- "reps": Strength exercises tracked by repetitions (push-ups, squats, rows)
- "duration": Time-based exercises (planks, dead hangs, stretches, cardio)
- "both": Can be tracked either way (carries, some cardio)

**Important:**
- exerciseCategory: Choose the most appropriate category for each exercise
- isCorrective: 1 for corrective exercises, 0 for regular exercises
- MUST include exercises from ALL categories: warmup, power, compound, isolation, core, cardio
- **ISOLATION EXERCISES (exerciseCategory: "isolation") must ONLY be "intermediate" or "advanced" difficulty, NEVER "beginner"**
- Compound exercises can be any difficulty level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- Essential compound exercises: Barbell Back Squat, Barbell Bench Press, Barbell Deadlift, Lat Pulldown, Bent-Over Row
- Essential isolation exercises: Bicep Curls, Tricep Extensions, Lateral Raises, Chest Flyes, Leg Curls, Calf Raises
- Essential power exercises: Jump Squats, Box Jumps, Medicine Ball Throws, Kettlebell Swings
- Ensure variety in movement patterns and difficulty levels
- Make exercise names clear and specific
- Form tips should be practical coaching cues`;
